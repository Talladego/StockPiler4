## Analysis: The Frame Slicing Pattern in `FrameWork`

In [`Source/Core/FrameWork.lua`](file:///c:/Games/Return%20of%20Reckoning/Interface/AddOns/StockPiler4/Source/Core/FrameWork.lua), the frame-slicing pattern implements a cooperative, time-sliced background job queue. 

**Executive Assessment:** In StockPiler4, `FrameWork` is an **architectural band-aid that treats symptoms rather than the root cause**. It successfully avoids single-frame micro-hitches, but does so at the cost of **asynchronous state inconsistency, UI latency, and massive scheduling complexity**.

---

### 1. The Rationale: Why It Was Introduced
In Warhammer Online's single-threaded Lua 5.1 environment, running heavy operations on a single frame causes perceptible hitching (>50–100ms) or stutter (>250ms).

During a harvest or bag storm, the addon historically tried to do all of the following in one frame:
1. Re-index 80+ bag slots.
2. Collect and parse specs for all watched recipes.
3. Walk bags for non-bound item matching (fingerprinting).
4. Run multi-bottle demand balancing.
5. Re-render 30+ complex XML watch list rows.

`FrameWork` sliced this pipeline across multiple frames:
- **Frame $N$:** UID count pass (`BeginWarmHaveSlice`)
- **Frame $N+1$:** Backpack spec scan pass (`FinishWarmHaveSlice`)
- **Frame $N+2$:** Demand calculation (`EnqueueDemand`)
- **Frame $N+3$:** Seed lines calculation (`EnqueueSeedLines`)
- **Frame $N+4$:** Full plan rebuild (`PlanRebuild`)
- **Frame $N+5$:** Watch list paint

On paper, spreading ~60ms of work across 6 frames (~10ms/frame at 60 FPS) prevents frame spikes.

---

### 2. The Failure Modes in Practice

While the pattern kept frame times low on synthetic benchmarks, it introduced critical secondary problems:

#### A. Temporal Desync & State Tearing
Because calculations are spread across 5–8 frames (~80–130ms), **game state changes while the calculation is in-flight**:
- Between Frame $N$ and Frame $N+3$, an item is harvested, consumed, or moved.
- Frame $N+3$ finishes calculating demand based on bag data from Frame $N$, creating an invalid plan.
- To prevent this, the code added complex cancellation hooks (`FW.Cancel`, `snapGen` guards), which abort the job mid-way and restart it from Frame 0.

#### B. The "Perpetual Delay" / UI Stagnation
To keep the UI consistent, [`Scheduler.lua`](file:///c:/Games/Return%20of%20Reckoning/Interface/AddOns/StockPiler4/Source/Core/Scheduler.lua#L217) explicitly **holds the full plan rebuild and Watch UI paint** while `FW.IsPrewarmBusy()` is true:
```lua
-- Hold full rebuild while FrameWork prewarm is mid-flight (collect/bag/demand/seeds).
if FW and FW.IsPrewarmBusy and FW.IsPrewarmBusy() == true then
    return
end
```
During active gameplay (rapid planting, harvesting, or buying), events fire continuously. `FrameWork` jobs keep getting re-enqueued or delayed by "quiet periods" (`plantQuiet`, `harvestStorm`). **The result is that the Watch tab and macro tooltips freeze on stale data (e.g. `craftable = 0` or `Restocking`) for 3 to 5 seconds after items are already in the bags.**

#### C. Excessive Coordination Code
Because `FrameWork` is asynchronous, the rest of the addon had to build dozens of flags to accommodate it:
- [`Scheduler.lua`](file:///c:/Games/Return%20of%20Reckoning/Interface/AddOns/StockPiler4/Source/Core/Scheduler.lua) has ~15 suppression variables (`_pendingPrewarmAfterQuiet`, `_skipPlanThisFrame`, `_skipUiHoldFooter`).
- Domain executors like [`Buy.lua`](file:///c:/Games/Return%20of%20Reckoning/Interface/AddOns/StockPiler4/Source/Buy.lua) and [`Brew.lua`](file:///c:/Games/Return%20of%20Reckoning/Interface/AddOns/StockPiler4/Source/Brew.lua) bypass the scheduler and mutate `PlanSnapshot.Get().rows` directly because waiting for `FrameWork` to finish slicing takes too long.

---

### 3. Root Cause vs. Symptom: Why Slicing Was Unnecessary

The only reason `FrameWork` was needed is that **StockPiler4's data structures are unindexed and perform redundant linear scans**:

1. **Unindexed Spec Matching:** Instead of indexing backpack items once into a lookup table, [`Planner.lua`](file:///c:/Games/Return%20of%20Reckoning/Interface/AddOns/StockPiler4/Source/Planner/Planner.lua) repeatedly performs full slot iterations to match material specs.
2. **GC Allocations in Loops:** In [`InventoryStore.lua`](file:///c:/Games/Return%20of%20Reckoning/Interface/AddOns/StockPiler4/Source/Stores/InventoryStore.lua#L80-L100), `RebuildFromBags` re-allocates 4 nested tables on every bag event. The perceived "hitch" was often garbage collection pauses, not pure CPU execution time.
3. **Expensive Demand Balancing:** Demand was recalculated from scratch rather than updated incrementally.

**Math in perspective:**
- A standard player has ~80 bag slots and tracks ~10–20 watched recipes.
- If bag items are indexed into a hash map by `{ [role_effect_tier] = count }` in a single $O(N)$ pass, matching all 20 watches takes **under 1.5 milliseconds**.
- **Slicing a 1.5ms operation across 5 frames with a 335-line state machine makes no sense.**

### 4. Recommendation for StockPiler4

| Strategy | StockPiler4 Approach | Recommended StockPiler4 Design |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bag Processing** | Linear scan, multi-frame slice | **Single-pass indexed table (`wipe`)** (~0.5ms) |
| **Planning Execution** | Spread across 4 prewarm jobs | **Synchronous pure plan calculation** (~1ms) |
| **Storm Handling** | FrameWork job queue + Quiet timers | **Simple Debounce / Coalesce window (e.g. 50ms)** |
| **UI Updates** | Gated on `FW.IsPrewarmBusy()` | **Direct render from immutable snapshot** |

#### Concrete Architecture in StockPiler4:
1. **Drop `FrameWork.lua` from the core planning loop entirely.**
2. **Replace Slicing with Coalescing (Debouncing):**
   - When a harvest storm fires 4 `BAG_UPDATE` events within 50ms, do not slice. Reset a 50ms coalesce timer.
   - When the 50ms timer expires, execute the entire pipeline synchronously:
     $$\text{Index Bags (0.5ms)} \longrightarrow \text{Compute Plan (1.0ms)} \longrightarrow \text{Publish Snapshot}$$
   - Total frame cost: **~1.5ms** (well within the 16.6ms budget for 60 FPS).
3. **Reserve Time-Slicing Only for Catalog Browsing:**
   - The *only* legitimate use for frame-slicing in RoR is populating an unindexed catalog of 500+ items or recipes when opening a search window for the first time. It should never sit between bag events and the craft macro readiness loop.

### 5. Practice update (0.4.31 plant / additive / harvest soak)

**Decision:** Do **not** reintroduce FrameWork slicing for CultivationUpdated / plant / additive / harvest spikes. Libperf trails (`Footer`+`RefreshWatch`+`CultivationUpdated` x4, `Orch`+`BufferFlags`+`CollectIntents`) were addressed with coalesce / quiet / peek:

| Spike | Non-slicing mitigation |
| :--- | :--- |
| CultivationUpdated x4 + Footer/RefreshWatch | Extend `ArmPlantQuiet` while plant/additive pending; skip Footer dirty while quiet |
| Additive mid-grow WakeAutoGrow | Quiet + SkipPlan/Ui; `SetAutoGrowIdle(false)` only (no plant-queue invalidate) |
| Orch plant then BufferFlags/CollectIntents | Drop post-plant `WakeAutoGrow`; orch peeks BufferFlags cache |

**Safety boundary:** Quiet holds Watch paint and plan rebuild for ~2s after plant/additive commits. AutoGrow still runs additives on the 1s tick (`SetAutoGrowIdle(false)`). Harvest still uses `ArmHarvestStorm`. Craftable / plantIntent correctness is not deferred across quiet — only UI flush and full PlanRebuild.
